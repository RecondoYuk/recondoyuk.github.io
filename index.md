  # Hello World! #
## About Me ##
I am a mess of a person just trying to learn a new skill or two.  I figure Elon is going to need someone to feed people on Mars so I'd better learn the tech side of things!

Don't.

This is a random blog post that is supposed to be about my interactions with Github so far.  

Well, so far it has been a challenge to say the least.  It's definitely a process to learn, but I *wish* I had learned it earlier.  It definitely would have helped me keep things organized better.
